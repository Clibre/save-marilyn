# Save Marilyn

Save Marilyn is an arcade game that you can play in your favorite browser.

## Why?

Clibre, an organisation that promotes open source software at UQÃ€M, organized a gamejam at the end of January 2016 having for
theme "Hollywood physics".

My friend [c0ltrane](https://github.com/c0ltrane)  and [I](https://github.com/gregsavoie) decided to participate and Save Marilyn is the result of about fifteen hours of pure fun. During that fifteen hours we had to learn Javascript and [Phaser](http://phaser.io), an open source desktop and mobile game framework. Since we had no prior knowledge of how to make a game, our code is really messy and ugly! Please be indulgent!

## How?

1. git clone  https://github.com/gregsavoie/gamejam-clibre.git
2. open the file "index.html" in you favorite browser
3. have fun!


I hope you will have as much fun to play the game as we had while making it!
